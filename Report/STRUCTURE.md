4. Detailed Contents
    -  introductory section
    -  literature review section 
       - a review of available relevant research on the subject matter
       - length depends upon how contested the subject matter is
       - you might use the literature review to highlight gaps in the existing knowledge, which your analysis will try to fill. 
       - this is where you formally introduce your research questions and hypothesis.
    -  methodology

       - The "discussion section" is where you rely on the power of narrative to enable numbers to communicate your thesis to your readers. You refer the reader to the research question and the knowledge gaps you identified earlier. You highlight how your findings provide the ultimate missing piece to the puzzle.
     - conclusion section 
       - you generalize your specific findings and take on a rather marketing approach to promote your findings so that the reader does not remain stuck in the caveats that you have voluntarily outlined earlier. 
       - You might also identify future possible developments in research and applications that could result from your research
5. Acknowledgments
    -  acknowledging the support of those who have enabled your work is always good
